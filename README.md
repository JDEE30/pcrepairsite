#### npm run build

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!You can simply upload all the files in your build folder to cpanel or your web hosts version of cpanel. This website stands alone.. So you don't need any other files present in the domains folder in cpanel.

###  More about this app
